MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, while Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction layer on top of MongoDB. Mongoose allows developers to define data models using a schema-based approach and provides a lot of convenience in the creation and management of data in MongoDB. In terms of Node.js, MongoDB is the native driver for interacting with a MongoDB instance and Mongoose is built on top of the MongoDB driver to provide programmers with a way to model their data.
